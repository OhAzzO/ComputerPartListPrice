This is my backup presentation due to having issues with my spring.
  This project is meant to help you with building a computer,
 knowing the cost and picking individual parts within your budget to build your own computer.

 This will give you an option to give your price that you would like to spend and using a function
  will suggest what computer you will be able to afford, the total price ( and eventually to be able to display each item
 in the corresponding list with it editable for personalised builds).
